## Hi<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/master/Assets/Hi.gif" alt="wav_hello" width="22" height="22"/>there, I'm [Prithvi](https://prithvi2k2.github.io/)!


- #### 🔭 I’m interested in programming and other computer science related stuff(couldn't narrow it down to specific fields like DS/AI-ML/Blockchain/IoT etc because I'm still exploring to choose one)
- #### 🌱 I’m currently learning to code
- #### 👯 I’m looking forward to collaborate on open-source projects and communities
- #### 🤔 I’m looking for help in contributing to open-source and enter competitive programming(I know they're far apart, but I wanna explore as much as I can)
- #### 📫 Reach me: mail to prithvi2k2@gmail.com or Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prithvi2k2/) or ping me on Discord @**Prithvi#1403**
